Overall, I enjoyed the Sinatra Project. I felt like this project was a lot more under control than my last one, and I could visualize what I was doing with my code. I felt like I had a direct path and it helped my lack of experience to be able to logically build my project in my head, and then go step by step creating what was needed. There were definitely times that I was getting upset here, but I knew that time would be made, and the students I was also working with seemed to skate by with me as well. I feel like the nights were not filled with worry about completing on time, nor was I ever stumped overnight with an issue which was amazing. This project really helped me restore faith in my ability to code and what I will be learning in the future. Being released on to my own doesn't seem nearly as bad anymore.
