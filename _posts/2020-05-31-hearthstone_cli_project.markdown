This project has been hands down one of the most difficult things I have had to do in a LONG time. Originally I though that our labs were very vague and difficult follow, but it is also something to appreciate due to the need to learn on your own, but this project was on it's own level of difficult. I struggled with this lab a lot due to a few determining factors that I will need to make sure to handle ahead of time for our next project. First, I could not get my local environment to work which at first I thought wouldn't be too bad, but after putting in countless hours each day, and attempting to troubleshoot on my own to no avail, I reached out for help. It took two days for it to be figured out and on Friday I was finally ready to begin my project. 

I had a lot of unnecessary stress that I had caused myself from trying to figure things out on my own when I should have asked for help, which caused me to need to take more breaks than usual to put the panic to rest. Luckily, our cohort has a mass of wonderful students that I have gotten the privilege to work with and they helped me a lot (special thanks to Kevin, Josh, Steve, and Shiyun).
