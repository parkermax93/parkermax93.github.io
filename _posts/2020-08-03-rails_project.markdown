Rails seemed a lot harder for me to grasp initially, compared to Object Oriented Ruby going into Sinatra. I feel like I originally thought that Rails was a lot of unnecessary confusing conecepts, but after learning a few of the tricks and how it can slow the repitition of code, and resuse the same things that you had done before. Towards the end, things started to click but I know that I still really need to work on my understanding of writing forms. Muscle memory will be the best practice for that, because I would love to know the basics of the syntax without looking it up. I know that this is not a taboo practice, but it is something that is done so frequently that I would love to be a little bit better at the memorization of it. I am very happy with how my project turned out, and I am looking forward to bootstrapping and styling it a little bit to eventually have it go live for a few friends of mine to play around on.
