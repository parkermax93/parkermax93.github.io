Whoa, where to start with this one... Learning JavaScript has by far been the most difficult task throughout the bootcamp thus far. I felt lost most of the way through, and needed quite a lot of external resources. I am happy that it ended up that way though, because it showed me that I can use the internet to find resources for anything if you dig deep enough, and spend enough time looking. I found almost every niche fix to what I was doing for every lesson in different places, and from what I have heard from developer friends, that is what a lot of coding is. Once you understand the basics, it is using that knowledge to be able to navigate yourself through endless amounts of information online to find what is relevant to you, and learning through that. 

That is what this project was for me. It was a lot of searching, a lot of learning as I go, and a LOT of frustration. Overall I believe my project turned out very well and I am happy with what is has become, and leaves me longing to add a little bit more functionality to it because I think it is also a practical website for my friends, and even myself. I think I definitely have a lot to improve upon, but I now know that it is possible to do that on my own. Just 24 hours ago I was ready to give up, call it a day, and take a failure on this project. The support of my loved ones helped me push through that, and had me spend just a little more time taking things slow and reading, and all of a sudden everything came together and started to appear, and just like that a second wind came upon me and I knocked out the last few issues I was having.

I think JavaScript is something that I will continue to practice in my free time due to the importance and relevance of it in the real world, but for now, I will need to continue focusing on what is handed to me through the lesson plans we are provided.
