For my final project of the Flatiron Curriculum, I had the privilege of learning React/Redux front end web development. I know I have said this every project, but this was by far the most difficult project I have come across for a multitude of reasons. The first being, my passion is back end development because it logically makes a lot of sense to me as far as picturing what I am creating, and talking myself through the relationships. I am not the most "creative" person, so neededing to visualize what I will be rendering and creating is a task in itself, and it is hard to learn the syntax while still learning the creative process as well. It was also a very in-depth framework that had a lot of differences from regular javascript in my opinion. This is one subject that when I graduate, I will definitely be reviewing my first few weeks of github pushes for my job search. I will be making sure to really iron out my gaps in knowledge that I know are there, and continue using my personal resources that have been linked to me, and referencing the people I know who currently develop in this language. I am looking forward to becoming better at this, but it really helped show me my love for back-end development and the flow difference between the two.
